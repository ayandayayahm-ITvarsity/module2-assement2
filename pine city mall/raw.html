            <p>Is G-star a good brand?
                They do frequently work with designers who make exclusive and limited-edition products for/in collaboration with G-Star & they also sell shoes, belts, coats etc. Both companies sell (relatively) good quality products but both Guess and G-Star have their own style so it depends on what you're looking for.</p>
